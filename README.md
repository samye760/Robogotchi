This application is to simulate a [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi); a real life robotic companion made in Japan. This one is virtual, though. But it still has wants and needs, including needing to be played with and taken care of. Using [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), you will be able to take care of your own robotic companion whom you name yourself. Just make to to keep its stats balanced so it will remain happy.
